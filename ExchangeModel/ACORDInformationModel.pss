    <Description>The Activity package defines the various activities that are associated with the insurance business, especially those in the underwriting and claims management areas.

During the underwriting process, insurance company needs to understand its exposed risk, based on the activities performed by the insured, either professionally or privately. For example, an insurance company may decide not to cover certain occupations or hobbies or may request an additional premium for the added risk.

During the claims management process, the insurance company needs to understand the circumstances that surround the loss event resulting in a claim. Activities describe what the different parties were doing at the time of the loss event.</Description>

    <Description>This sub-package covers the definition of facultatives, facultatives being sub-types of agreements between a cedent and a reinsurer.

A Facultative reinsurance is set up to re-insure a specific contract; it means the risk is taken in charge by this reinsurance contract that cannot be re-insured under a mandatory treaty.

Facultative reinsurance is issued on an individual analysis of the situation and facts of the underlying policy.

It may cover all or part of the underlying policy. By deciding coverage case by case, the reinsurer can determine if it wants the risk associated with that particular policy.

Facultative reinsurance is used by the reinsured to reduce the chance of loss or risk associated with a certain policy.</Description>
  </Package>
  <Package isSynthetic='true' name='Reinsurance Treaty Agreement Subtypes' originalName='Reinsurance Treaty Agreement Subtypes' javaPackage='org.acord.aim.Agreement.ReinsuranceTreatyAgreementSubtypes' owningPackage='Agreement'>
    <Description>This sub-package covers the definition of treaties, treaties being sub-types of agreements between a cedent and a reinsurer.
Treaties correspond to mandatory re-insurance. Mandatory reinsurance is the re-insurance of any contract that falls within the limit of the treaty. It is the most common.

Treaty reinsurance is written to cover a particular class of policies issued by the reinsured.

Treaty reinsurance automatically passes the risk to the reinsurer for all policies that are covered by the treaty, not just one particular policy.
Treaty policies are more general than facultative policies because the reinsurance decision is based on general potential liability rather than on a specific enumerated risk.

There are two types of reinsurance treaty:  Proportional Treaty and Non-Proportional treaty. 

The first one is used to split the premium and the insured capital equally between the insurer and the re-insurer as well as the claim amount: this is the share. The second one is non-proportional treaty; the re-insurer covers until a certain amount (capacity) the excess of claim fixed amount (priority). In this category is also excess treaty and stop loss treaty.

The re-insurer can specify the type of risk that will be covered by the treaty.</Description>

    <Description>The Finance package orients primarily around the finances of an insurance company as seen from an accountant's perspective. There are two main ideas that form the base of the package:

1. Accounts - including physical accounts such as a bank account and logical accounts such accounting accounts that involve entries in a journal or logical accounts for budget allocation.

2. Financial Activities - information about the kinds of financial "things" (e.g., processes, transactions) that involve finances (e.g., money, stock, accounting adjustments). The most basic types of activities that involve money coming into or out of the insurance company. 

Underlying the Finance package is the notion of a financial provision. Provision is used to explain how funds are allocated. For example, the way money is allocated (or provisioned) to pay commissions. Again, the Information Model contains information about these provisions.</Description>
  </Package>
  <Package isSynthetic='true' name='Account Subtypes' originalName='Account Subtypes' javaPackage='org.acord.aim.Finance.AccountSubtypes' owningPackage='Finance'>
    <Description>Account in this context involves two types:

1. Physical accounts - such as a bank account or investment account. These types of accounts are all third party accounts. An exception to this is an AssetHolding, which is likely the holding of an insured.

2. Logical accounts - these are the accountant's view of an account, which orients around logical groupings for things like budget allocation and tracking. These types of accounts all fall under the concept of GeneralAccount.

AccountEntry is main idea for general accounts. The entries are conceptually similar to an accounting journal (in fact, the AccountEntry is a the granular idea for a Journal in the model).</Description>
  </Package>
  <Package isSynthetic='true' name='Agreement Financial Activity' originalName='Agreement Financial Activity' javaPackage='org.acord.aim.Finance.AgreementFinancialActivity' owningPackage='Finance'>
    <Description>Perhaps the most important (an common) financial activities involve agreements; both policies and non-policy agreements (e.g., vendor agreements). Included in these concepts is the idea of fund allocations, for saving contracts or policies. 

Outgoing funds (i.e., MoneyOutActivity) including ideas such as contract loan payments and surrenders. Incoming funds (i.e., MoneyInActivity) include ideas such as premium collection (which are broken down into the specific premium parts the money is applied to) and policy loan repayments.

Throughout the sub-package, relevant parts of the model are related - for example, the agreement component(s) that a premium payment is being applied to.</Description>
  </Package>
  <Package isSynthetic='true' name='Agreement Investment Activity' originalName='Agreement Investment Activity' javaPackage='org.acord.aim.Finance.AgreementInvestmentActivity' owningPackage='Finance'>
    <Description>This sub-package, while rather under-developed provides the placeholder for financial activities involving policies that have investment elements (i.e., life policies). Since implementations of the nature of investment operations can vary significantly, the model only captures basic information including trade orders and how funds are allocated.

Implementors of the model are expected to add their own financial operations and details.</Description>
  </Package>
  <Package isSynthetic='true' name='Agreement Loan' originalName='Agreement Loan' javaPackage='org.acord.aim.Finance.AgreementLoan' owningPackage='Finance'>
    <Description>This sub-package details the problematics related to contract loan management.

A contract loan (or policy loan) is a loan made by a life insurance company from its general funds to a policy owner on the security of the cash value of a policy. Generally, loans may reduce the policy's death benefit and cash value.

Loans are usually performed on life savings contracts.</Description>
  </Package>
  <Package isSynthetic='true' name='Bank Account' originalName='Bank Account' javaPackage='org.acord.aim.Finance.BankAccount' owningPackage='Finance'>
    <Description>A bank account is the traditional idea of a place to hold and exchange money through a bank. 
The only concept - BankAccount has important associations that outline the meaning of the concept, including using the account for financial operations.</Description>
  </Package>
  <Package isSynthetic='true' name='Claim Financial Activity' originalName='Claim Financial Activity' javaPackage='org.acord.aim.Finance.ClaimFinancialActivity' owningPackage='Finance'>
    <Description>This sub-package shows the concepts related to paying claims (out) and receiving claims funds (for example, through subrogation). 

Like most financial operations, MoneyOutActivity and MoneyInActivity are the main concepts. The claim funds are broken down into atomic parts (where necessary) with the ClaimFinancialBeakdown concept. The actual claim (ClaimCoverage and Damage) are related to the payments/receipts using ClaimFinancialBreakdown.

Otherwise, sub-types of ClaimMoneyOut and ClaimMoneyIn show the different types of claim payments that can be made or received.</Description>

  <Package isSynthetic='true' name='Commission Fee Tax Financial Activity' originalName='Commission Fee Tax Financial Activity' javaPackage='org.acord.aim.Finance.CommissionFeeTaxFinancialActivity' owningPackage='Finance'>
    <Description>Commissions are an important element of an insurance company's financial operations. Whether commissions are paid or refunded, it's important for commissions to be explicitly identified, which is the nature of this simple sub-package. 

MoneyInActivity and MoneyOutActivity serve as the basis for the commission-specific concepts, such as refunds or settlements.</Description>

  <Package isSynthetic='true' name='Financial Activity Subtypes' originalName='Financial Activity Subtypes' javaPackage='org.acord.aim.Finance.FinancialActivitySubtypes' owningPackage='Finance'>
    <Description>The base building blocks of financial activities are contained in the Financial Activity sub-package. The most commonly used concepts are MoneyInActivity and MoneyOutActivity.

However, there are other kinds of financial operations contained within the model, including TradeOrder, AccountToAccountAllocationActivity, and AdjustmentActivity. Collectively, they represent information about all the "things" you can do with finances in insurance.

At this level (i.e., within this package), you will find not only the core concepts, but also the core relationship with other concepts in the model. For example, the fundamental relationship between FinancialActivity and Currency.</Description>
  </Package>
  <Package isSynthetic='true' name='Financial Provision Subtypes' originalName='Financial Provision Subtypes' javaPackage='org.acord.aim.Finance.FinancialProvisionSubtypes' owningPackage='Finance'>
    <Description>A financial provision is an allocation of some kind of fund or investment for a specific purpose. FinancialProvision is the core concept of this sub-package, which extends to provides details about the kinds of provisions that exist in the model.

Fundamentally, the Information Model breaks down provisions into a "main" part (i.e., FinancialProvision) and atomic parts (i.e., FinancialProvisionElement). You use the main part as the whole and the atomic parts to add details.

For example, you can create a Premium FinancialProvision and add the parts for Commission, Charge, and PurePremium.</Description>

  <Package isSynthetic='true' name='Financial Scheduler Subtypes' originalName='Financial Scheduler Subtypes' javaPackage='org.acord.aim.Finance.FinancialSchedulerSubtypes' owningPackage='Finance'>
    <Description>A financial scheduler is used to describe information about payments (made or received) that happen on some regular interval. It also describes on a more general level, the idea of installments, which usually happen on some interval.

In the model, all payments (in and out) are "scheduled," even if they are just one-time payments. 

The main concept within this sub-package is FinancialScheduler, which is extended for outbound (FinancialOutScheduler) and inbound (FinancialInScheduler) payments. In addition, the notion of Installment (which is not a subtype of FinancialScheduler). 

At this level, you will find the core relationships with things like FinancialActivity (and the relevant sub-types of FinancialActivity) and AccountEntry (et al.).</Description>

  <Package isSynthetic='true' name='Installment Subtypes' originalName='Installment Subtypes' javaPackage='org.acord.aim.Finance.InstallmentSubtypes' owningPackage='Finance'>
    <Description>The Installment Subtypes Sub-Package accounts for the concept of financial installments, whether they qualify as money-in (e.g. receivable) or money-out (e.g. payable) within the scope of finance, schedules, payment methods and the like, including associations to agreements and/or claims.</Description>
  </Package>
  <Package isSynthetic='true' name='Payment Method Subtypes' originalName='Payment Method Subtypes' javaPackage='org.acord.aim.Finance.PaymentMethodSubtypes' owningPackage='Finance'>
    <Description>Ultimately, many finance-related concepts result in payments and those payments are handled through some physical means. This sub-package captures basic information about those means (or methods) including cash, check, and electronic funds transfers.

ACORD did not attempt to model the entire set of information about payment methods since other models in the banking industry are probably better suited for such information (and insurance companies don't always keep such fine-grained information). However, the core concepts are represented and connected to both MoneyInOperation and MoneyOutOperation, the two most often used financial operations.</Description>

    <Description>The Investment Package is specific to Savings Products. It covers all the investment related processes and information related to fund handling, and is used to manage savings products. If a client subscribes a Savings product, their incentives, regular premiums paid, or unsolicited payments will be invested on funds subscribed at the contract level. 
If a client requests a total or partial surrender of his contract, money will be disinvested from the funds. 
The features of funds (traded on the stock market) and of the insurer (who provides the savings product) have to be set up in this domain. 

The fund definition is handled in PDT domain. Two types of funds can be managed: interest based fund and unit-linked fund. On a regular basis unit funds quotations are updated with values provided by the stock market. 
The insurer records all investment and disinvestment flows during contract’s life (see CTR and FIN). Those currency flows are convertible into unit amounts at that time. 
The investment date of the flow can be parameterized. It is normally specified at the product level, in relation with the investment vehicle (fund). It is possible to specify that the investment can only be a working day (If not, the date should be switched programmatically).  
When money is invested in funds, it is then converted in units. The first run will sell or buy estimated units based on estimated share prices; the second run will adjust the previous orders with the right price. It means the contract holds units of funds.
And on a regular basis, those units are sent to the stockbrokers (funds managers) to be really invested or disinvested on the stock market. 

The back-office administration feature  is used to record management of these units sent to the stockbroker, whether buy orders or sell orders. 
The insurer has the option to set up a buffer stock that allows him to have orders sent, if the limit of the buffer stock is exceeded, or purchase shares, if it falls below the limit. Orders can be cumulated to avoid paying too many fees. Indeed, units and order design are decoupled and managed differently. 

If needed, the insurer is able to get details of its fund portfolio in a fund account. The account deals with accounting information regarding funds the insurer provides to clients. For example, how many shares does it own? What is the current balance regarding a specific fund?</Description>

    <Description>The Account And Fund package makes it possible to model various types of accounts that are of interest to the modeled organization from an operational point of view. The different types of accounts that need to be considered include customer accounts, reserve accounts, and funds. &#x0d;
Accounting is a very complex, often highly regulated discipline. Although accounting principles in general, and the way an organization handles its accounting processes, are outside the scope of this document, accounts identified in the Account And Fund package are used in the accounting process. This means the Account And Fund package should be extended for handling the full scope of the accounting process</Description>

    <Description>This sub-Package describes the set up and handling of fund administration and is used to define two types of fund: unit linked funds and interest based funds. Unit linked funds are funds which are updated regularly, with regular values. This process can be manual or automatic; it can be daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.

Interest based funds are funds which are based on an interest rate. The interest guaranteed rate can be specified and then the real interest rate can be entered when it is known.  
The ISIN code, the description area, the financial risk (High, medium, low), the stock-market it belongs to, the fund currency, the manager of the fund, the country of residence of the fund, the rules for prices update, describes the funds.
Values like bid, offer, face value, and the dividend can be defined for unit-linked funds.</Description>

This sub-Package specifies two types of calendar values that can be used in the investment domain.
When money is invested on a saving contact or dis-invested from, the investment date can be shifted according to a rule that applies to the calendar values of the stock exchange place or of the fund selected at contract level. 
The sub-package specifies two types of calendar values that can be used in the investment domain. 
Values stands for the date and its status (working day or non-working day) of the stock exchange place or of the fund.</Description>

An insurer investment portfolio is seen as an account (see FIN/Account).
The insurer has the possibility to know the number of shares he owns, whether by fund(s) or in total that are traded on the stock market.

Two kinds of account can be set up: the first one is a detailed account, which will detail the state of shares concerning one fund, and the second is a summary account. 
For one account, the insurer can know:
- The fund cash value
- The estimated cash value at a certain date
- The status of the account
- The creation date (start date)
- The end date (if it is not anymore valid)
- The quantity of share invested on the fund.

    <Description>This package defines concepts associated with various types of registration. A registration is considered a formal recording, by an authorized body, of the granting of rights, privileges, favors, statuses, or qualifications. Registrations are important from the perspective of being a qualified source of information. They are similar to assessments in the respect that the associated information can be considered more reliable than the same information not associated with a registration.

The scope of registration includes and is not limited to: parties (e.g. driver's license, passport), animals, events (e.g. catastrophe), products and objects (vehicle registration, drug registration).

NOTE: One detail typical of a registration involves the utility of an identifier, assigned by the registering authority. The determining factor on when such an identifier is a "registration" involves the role of the concept associated with the registration. For example, insurers often assign an identifier to a producer on an insurance policy to distinguish that producer from all others with whom it does business. In this scenario, the identifier is associated with the role of the party acting as the producer. This scenario is not a registration and the identifier would be managed outside the "registration" concept in the model.</Description>

    <Description>This specialization of AgreementClauseComponent allows to define a no claim bonus clause.

A no claim bonus is a bonus awarded to a policyholder when no claims have been made on an insurance policy during the period of insurance, usually one year. The bonus is subsequently applied to reduce the renewal premium.

The motor insurance business uses this approach extensively and companies will usually increase no claim bonuses annually up to a maximum, typically 60%, after four or five years. This method of rewarding policyholders with no claims is sometimes used in household insurance.</Description>

      <Description>This concept gives informations on a person's profile in a key person insurance context.
Key person insurance is a particular type of life insurance policy taken out by a company on one of their employees, in which the company is the beneficiary in the case of that employee's untimely demise. Key person insurance is a relatively new phenomenon, but has attracted much praise and is encouraged by many strategic advisors. Life insurance is basically a system by which a fixed amount of money is paid to a beneficiary in the event that the person being covered dies. Most life insurance companies offer a type of key person insurance, as it has become more and more necessary in the modern business world.

There are four categories of loss for which key person insurance can provide compensation:
1. Losses related to the extended period when a key person is unable to work, to provide temporary personnel and, if necessary to finance the recruitment and training of a replacement.

2. Insurance to protect profits. For example, offsetting lost income from lost sales, losses resulting from the delay or cancellation of any business project that the key person was involved in, loss of opportunity to expand, loss of specialized skills or knowledge.

3. Insurance to protect shareholders or partnership interests. Typically this is insurance to enable shareholdings or partnership interests to be purchased by existing shareholders or partners.

4. Insurance for anyone involved in guaranteeing business loans or banking facilities. The value of insurance coverage is arranged to equal the value of the guarantee.
A key person can be anyone directly associated with the business whose loss can cause financial strain to the business. For example, the person could be a director of the company, a partner, a key sales person, key project manager, or someone with specific skills or knowledge which is especially valuable to the company.
Syn: key man insurance or keyman insurance.</Description>

A loss payee clause (or loss payable clause) is a clause in a contract of insurance which provides that in the event of payment being made under the policy in relation to the insured risk, payment will be made to a third party rather than to the insured beneficiary of the policy. Such clauses are common where the insured property is subject to a mortgage or other security interest and the mortgagee (ie. usually a bank) requires that the property be insured and that such a clause be included.

      <Description>A party (person or organization) that is not automatically included as an insured under the agreement (e.g. contract) of another (insured) party, but for whom the named insured's agreement provides a certain degree of protection.

An endorsement is typically required to effect additional insured status. The named insured's impetus for providing additional insured status to others may be a desire to protect the other person or organization because of a close relationship with that person or organization (e.g., employees or members of an insured club), or to comply with a contractual agreement requiring the named insured to do so (e.g., customers or owners of property leased by the named insured).</Description>

    <Enumerand isSynthetic='true' name='FirstNamed' generator='First Named'>
      <Description>The first name on the declaration page of the agreement (e.g. contract).

Explanation: Because there is wording in the contract specific to 'First Name Insured'. The first Named Insured is required to keep records. Audit and cancellations notices are sent to the first Named Insured. Non-renewal notice is sent to the first Named Insured. The contract is very specific.</Description>

      <Description>A party (person or organization), other than the first named insured, identified as an insured in the agreement (e.g. contract) declarations or an addendum to the contract declarations.

Explanation: It can be all the Named Insured on the declarations page other than the First Named Insured. It could also apply as you endorse another party onto the declarations page. Or sometimes, it can apply when you acquire a new operation or organization.

The name on the declaration page of the contract. Explanation: There is wording in the CGL form that specifically refers to the Named Insured. For instance, 'No person or organization is an insured with respect to the conduct of any current or past partnership, joint venture or limited liability company that is not shown as a Named Insured in the Declarations.' See also Insured.

The term additional named insured has not acquired a uniformly agreed-upon meaning within the insurance industry, and use of the term in the two different senses defined above often produces confusion in requests for additional insured status between contracting parties.</Description>
    </Enumerand>
    <Enumerand isSynthetic='true' name='Primary' generator='Primary'>
      <Description>A party covered as defined in the insurance contract that is named as the primary insured. Coverage is provided primarily to the primary insured and the insurer will primarily deal with the primary insured, or his representative, for all issues concerning the insurance policy. 

In life insurance policies there is one designated insured, the person so named; or a contract can be issued to numerous insureds on a group basis.

For non-life insurance policies (e.g. P&amp;C, general insurance) the primary insured is often referred to as the "first named insured" with corresponding responsibilities and provisions as outlined in the agreement.

For example, a personal auto policy may show "John Doe" as the policyholder on the declarations page, thereby making him the "first named insured". John's wife and children who reside with him would be considered "insureds" on this policy.</Description>

A loss payee clause (or loss payable clause) is a clause in a contract of insurance which provides that in the event of payment being made under the policy in relation to the insured risk, payment will be made to a third party rather than to the insured beneficiary of the policy. Such clauses are common where the insured property is subject to a mortgage or other security interest and the mortgagee (ie. usually a bank) requires that the property be insured and that such a clause be included.

      <Description>Trustee is a legal term for a holder of property on behalf of a beneficiary. A trust can be set up either to benefit particular persons, or for any charitable purposes (but not generally for non-charitable purposes): typical examples are a will trust for the testator's children and family, a pension trust (to confer benefits on employees and their families), and a charitable trust. In all cases, the trustee may be a person or company, whether or not they are a prospective beneficiary.

SOURCE: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustee

A party (e.g. person or an organization) which holds and manages assets on behalf of another via a trust agreement. For example, trustees are appointed to manage a scheme. They are responsible for investing the contributions, paying out the benefits and generally looking after scheme members' interests. The trustees may be appointed from management or staff; sometimes trustees independent of the insurance company are used.</Description>

      <Description>A deposit premium is the amount of premium (usually for an Excess of loss contract) that the Ceding company pays to the reinsurer on a periodic basis during the term of the contract. This amount is generally determined as a percentage of the estimated amount of premium which the contract will produce based on the rate and estimated subject premium. It is often the same as the minimum premium but may be higher or lower. The deposit premium will be adjusted to the higher of the actual developed premium or the minimum premium after the actual subject premium has been determined.

This occurs in cases where all relevant exposure or rating information are not known at the start of the period of cover, or the premium to be paid is dependent on the claims experience during the policy term. An initial premium is paid at the start of the period of cover, followed by an adjustment at the end when the information required is known.

Where this latter adjustment is stipulated at the outset as being upwards only, the term "Minimum and Deposit Premium" applies.

Where it is found in cases relating to retrospective experience rating, the term "swing rated premium" is often applied.</Description>

It can be interpreted in amount, percentage, time unit.

Franchise clause: Clause found in a marine insurance policy that states that the policy will not pay any claims less than a given amount but will pay claims in excess of that amount. The purpose of this clause is to eliminate the costs associated with processing small claims because their costs could easily exceed the actual amount of the claim.

    <Description>This concept defines the deductible characteristics of the selected coverage.

In an insurance policy, the deductible (North American term) or excess (UK term) is the portion of any claim that is not covered by the insurance provider. It is the amount of expenses that must be paid out of pocket before an insurer will cover any expenses. It is normally quoted as a fixed quantity and is a part of most policies covering losses to the policy holder. The deductible must be paid by the insured, before the benefits of the policy can apply. Typically, a general rule is: the higher the deductible, the lower the premium, and vice versa.

In a typical automobile insurance policy, a deductible will apply to claims arising from damage to or loss of the policy holder's own vehicle, whether this damage/loss is caused by accidents for which the holder is responsible, or vandalism and theft. Third-party liability coverage generally has no deductible, since the third party will likely attempt to recover any loss, however small, for which the policy holder is liable.

Most health insurance policies and some travel insurance policies have deductibles as well. The type of health insurance deductibles can also vary, as individual amounts and family amounts. Major medical insurance policies are known for often having a deductible which does not cover the cost of routine visits (e.g., to a doctor's office).

For example, a person might have an auto insurance policy with a $500 deductible on collision coverage. If this person were in an accident that did $800 worth of damage to the car, then the insurance company would pay him or her $300. The insured is responsible for the first $500 of damage (the deductible), and the insurance company pays the balance. In industrial risks it is also common for the deductible to be expressed as a percentage of the loss, often though not always, with a minimum and maximum amount, for example 10% of loss minimum 1,500USD max 5,000USD. Therefore in the event of a claim totaling 25,000USD the applicable deductible is 2,500 (i.e. 10% of the loss), meaning that the assured would receive an indemnity payment from the insurer of 22,500USD. If the claim only amounts to 7,500USD then the applicable deductible is 1,500USD and not 10% of the loss, since 10% is below the minimum deductible level. Similarly, in this instance, for losses above 50,000USD the deductible will never be more than 5,000USD. Deductibles can also differ depending on the cause of the claim: the same policy can contain varying deductibles which are applied to loss or damage arising from theft, fire, natural perils, etc.

For example a plastics factory may have a deductible of 10,000 for theft, 50,000 for natural perils and 100,000 for fire.

There are two types of deductibles:
- Straight deductible: A straight deductible is a deductible that applies to each separate loss, and is the type of deductible in most personal lines of insurance. For instance, if, during the course of a year, you are involved in 2 separate auto accidents, then the deductible will be subtracted for each accident.
- Aggregate deductible:
Commercial insurance often has an aggregate deductible, which is the total deductible for a given policy period. For instance, if a business has property insurance with an aggregate deductible of $10,000, then the business will have to cover the 1st $10,000 worth of losses for each policy period - usually a year. So if, during the course of a year, a business has 3 separate losses of $2,000, then $6,000, then $4,000, the business will be have to cover $10,000 of its losses, but will receive $2,000 from its insurance company for the last loss. Any more losses that occur within the same policy period will be fully covered. So if the business has another loss of $3,000, it will receive the full amount from its insurer.
An aggregate deductible makes more sense in commercial insurance, since businesses can have many separate losses during the course of a year, but would be unusual for an individual to experience multiple losses within a year.

A deductible should never be confused with a franchise, the latter representing a threshold which needs to be exceeded in order for the insurer to be liable for the entirety of the claim. In other words, with a franchise of 20,000USD a claim of 19,900 USD is borne entirely by the assured whereas in the event of a claim totaling 20,500 USD the insurer would be liable for the whole amount.</Description>

  <EntityType isSynthetic='true' name='org.acord.aim.Agreement.AgreementRequest.StatusChangeRequest' originalName='StatusChangeRequest' superclassName='org.acord.aim.Agreement.AgreementRequest.FinancialServicesRequest' isAbstract='false'>
    <Description>A request that results in a change to the life cycle status of a financial services agreement. Each modeled organization may have its own variety of statuses resulting from status change requests.
 
e.g: Cancellation Request: A request that leads to the end of the financial services agreement. Such a request can be initiated by the customer or by the modeled organization. In the latter case, different circumstances may exist, such as the nonrenewable of the next insurance agreement term for underwriting reasons, the termination of a pending insurance agreement due to non-acceptance of the risk, the nonrenewable of a credit card agreement due to the customer's bad reimbursement history.

e.g: Full Surrender Request: A request that leads to the end of the financial services agreement. The accumulated value of the insurance agreement minus surrender charges is paid out to the insured and all the coverages provided under the insurance agreement are ended.

e.g: Lapse Request: A request to put the financial services agreement in a lapse status. In insurance, such a request may be triggered by the non-payment of premiums. Lapse processing may include the execution of non-forfeiture or exit options if there is cash value.

e.g: Maturity Request: A request to put a financial services agreement in a matured status. Typically, in life insurance, a maturity request is triggered when life insurance death proceeds or endowments are paid, either at the death of an insured or at the end of the endowment period.

e.g: Policy Conversion Request: Converts a policy to another policy, ending the first one, creating a new policy and transferring value from the ended to the new policy. Typically done for changing to a different product, like for instance when moving the value of a group pension policy to an individual annuity policy.

e.g: Quote Request: A request for a price estimate for a financial services agreement. In the case of insurance, a quote is a price estimate for an insurance cover, typically requested by a prospective customer to explore insurance alternatives and to obtain a quick rate quotation.

e.g: Reactivation Request: A request to reestablish a financial services agreement's in-force status after suspension.

e.g: Reinstatement Request: A request to place a previously lapsed financial services agreement back in force. In the case of an insurance policy, the insurance policy may have lapsed because of non-payment of premiums, or be a life insurance agreement that continues as extended term or reduced paid-up insurance.

e.g: Renewal Request: A request to renew a preexisting financial services agreement. Typically, in insurance, it represents the request for automatically reestablishing an insurance policy's in-force status, usually achieved through payment of the premium due.

e.g: Suspension Request: A request to place an financial services agreement in a suspend state. This means that no externally requested or automatic life-cycle event for this financial services agreement is further possible. The request may be initiated by the customer (for a limited period of time), by a producer or servicer (e.g. for the processing of a pending death claim), or by the modeled organization (e.g. whenever the withdrawals on a credit card have exceeded the withdrawal limit for a period of time). Typically, in insurance, any substantial increase of hazard in the risk covered may trigger a suspension request.</Description>

    <Description>Fronting refers to the use of an insurer to issue paper, i.e., an insurance policy, on behalf of a self-insured organization or captive insurer without the intention of bearing any of the risk. 

The risk of loss is transferred back to the self-insured or captive insurer with an indemnity or reinsurance agreement. However, the fronting company (insurer) assumes a credit risk since it would be required to honor the obligations imposed by the policy if the self-insurer or captive failed to indemnify it. Fronting companies charge a fee for this service, generally between 5 and 10 percent of the premium being written. Fronting arrangements allow captives and self-insurers to comply with financial responsibility laws imposed by many states that require evidence of coverage written by an admitted insurer, such as for auto and workers compensation insurance. Fronting arrangements must also be used in business contracts with other organizations, such as leases and construction contracts, where evidence of coverage through an admitted insurer is also required.

Fronting is a device used for circumventing regulatory requirements, whereby an insurer who is not licensed in a particular country or state employs the services of a licensed local primary insurer to write a piece of business (which is otherwise produced or controlled by him) with the specific understanding that the entire risk would be transferred to him by way of reinsurance.</Description>

    <Description>This concept represents the agreement between a cedent and a reinsurer.

The two basic methods of reinsurance are Facultative and Treaty. Within the scope of each of these two methods, there are two broad types - Proportional (or contributing) reinsurance and Non-Proportional (or non-contributing) reinsurance.
Facultative reinsurance is an optional method, under which the direct insurer (ceding company or cedent) offers each risk individually to the reinsurer for his consideration. The reinsurer consequently receives full details of each risk offered, as he would if he were to write it on a direct basis, and he has the option to reject the offer or to agree to acceptance on such terms and conditions as he may prescribe. The offer and acceptance are thus optional on both sides, and there is no valid contract until and unless the offer is accepted. 
Treaty reinsurance is an obligatory method based on an agreement concluded for a specified period of time (usually 12-month period, renewable annually) covering a defined concept or concepts of business. Details of individual risks are not provided (barring exceptional cases providing for submission of bordereaux). The cedent is obliged to cede all risks falling within the scope of the agreement, and the reinsurer is obliged to accept all such cessions without the option to decline or to ask for improved terms. Offer and acceptance are thus automatic, and the offer becomes a contract as soon as it is made (rather than as soon as it is accepted - as under the facultative method).

Proportional (synonyms: share reinsurance or pro rata reinsurance) and Non-proportional reinsurance:
Under proportional reinsurance, the cedent and the reinsurer share the original risk on pro rata basis, and they also share the premiums and claims in the same proportion. This concept could be applied to an individual risk (facultative) or to a number of risks covered by a single contract (treaty). There is thus a complete community of interest between the parties to the contract.

Basic methods and types of reinsurance: 
 Facultative:
 - Proportional = Proportional facultative
 - Non-Proportional = Risk Excess, Layered Cover, Facultative Stop Loss
 Treaty:
 - Proportional = Quota Share, Surplus, Combined Quota-cum-Surplus
 - Non-Proportional = Per Risk Excess of Loss, Working Excess of Loss, Catastrophe Excess of Loss, Aggregate Excess of Loss (Stop Loss)
 Semi-automatic arrangements:
 - Proportional = Automatic Facultative Cover, Facultative Obligatory Cover, Line Slip
 - Non-Proportional = Coded Excess of Loss, Excess of Loss Line Slip

Inception date = Commencement date of the contract.
Expiration date = Date of cessation of a reinsurance cover, when the time period for which it was written has ended. A treaty written on a "continuous until canceled" basis does not expire automatically but will contain a provision for termination.</Description>

    <Description>A surety bond is a promise to pay one party (the obligee) a certain amount if a second party (the principal) fails to meet some obligation, such as fulfilling the terms of a contract. The surety bond protects the obligee against losses resulting from the principal's failure to meet the obligation.

SOURCE: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surety_bond

Often, a surety bond agreement involves three parties:
(1) Obligee (2) Principal (3) Surety
Common practice involves the principal and surety signing the bond (contract/agreement). The contract language/form is prescribed by obligee. The agent/producer signs on behalf of surety under a power of attorney.

Use Case: The city of Smallville needs a road to be constructed. It documents the requirements and then gives contractors time to bid the job. Whichever contractor is awarded the job (low bid) must be "bonded" (e.g. The contractor must have a bond backed by a surety. The bond language is prescribed by Smallville (obligee). The bond describes the work to be performed by the contractor (principal) and states that the surety (insurance company) will get the work performed or provide finances to conclude the work in the event the contractor is unable to complete the project/fulfill its obligation).</Description>

      <Description>A code classifying a party's role as an additional interest on an agreement.

NOTE: For property and casualty insurance, the classification of the interest is typically as a third party to the given agreement. For example, an insurance policy covering a dwelling critically involves two parties: (1) the policyholder/insured (2) the insurer. The party in the role of insured on the insurance agreement may also be a participant in a loan agreement, where it plays the role of borrower/mortgagor with another party playing the role of lender/mortgagee. The party acting as the lender in the loan agreement may require it be listed as "mortgagee" on the insurance agreement covering the dwelling. In this scenario, the party acting as the lender in the loan agreement has an additional interest in the insurance agreement and is accounted for as some type of additional interest or third party on the insurance agreement. Such additional interests may be classified for clarity on the insurance agreement. The lender plays the primary/first party role of "mortgagee" on the loan agreement. On the insurance agreement, the lender is playing a third party/additional interest role that can be classified as "mortgagee".</Description>

    <Description>Facultative reinsurance is an optional method, under which the direct insurer (ceding company or cedent) offers each risk individually to the reinsurer for his consideration. The reinsurer consequently receives full details of each risk offered, as he would if he were to write it on a direct basis, and he has the option to reject the offer or to agree to acceptance on such terms and conditions as he may prescribe. The offer and acceptance are thus optional on both sides, and there is no valid contract until and unless the offer is accepted.

Facultative reinsurance is the oldest form of reinsurance, having been derived from the concept of coinsurance or sharing of an individual risk by a number of insurers. The basic difference between the two methods is that under the facultative method it is only the primary insurer who has a contractual liability under the original insurance whereas, under coinsurance, each participating insurer has a direct and individual relationship with the original insured - although without any joint or collective liability.
The word 'facultative' means 'optional' or as implying a faculty, that is a 'facility or power to act according to a free choice'. In the early days of reinsurance (up to the middle of the 19th century), reinsurance in U.K. was effected facultatively between one direct office and another - usually on the basis of reciprocal support through an exchange of risks. However, this situation gave rise to worry in the minds of primary insurers that they were disclosing too much information on their book of business to competitors. This problem was resolved with the emergence of professional reinsurers, who posed no threat of direct competition.
The problem of confidentiality was further eased with the development of the treaty method, which enabled direct insurers to purchase reinsurance without disclosing sensitive details of each risk to the reinsurer. Despite extensive use of treaties, the facultative method is however still employed today owing to the expanding size of risks as also the increase in their hazard and complexity, leading to greater need for consultation between cedent and reinsurer.

    <Description>A reinsurance treaty is a reinsurance convention between an insurer and a reinsurer defining the terms under which the risks covered by the convention are ceded and accepted.
The two main categories of treaty reinsurance are proportional and non-proportional. 
Treaty reinsurance is an obligatory method based on an agreement concluded for a specified period of time (usually 12-month period, renewable annually) covering a defined concept or concepts of business. Details of individual risks are not provided (barring exceptional cases providing for submission of bordereaux). The cedent is obliged to cede all risks falling within the scope of the agreement, and the reinsurer is obliged to accept all such cessions without the option to decline or to ask for improved terms. Offer and acceptance are thus automatic, and the offer becomes a contract as soon as it is made (rather than as soon as it is accepted - as under the facultative method).

This concept is the parent concept for the different treaty concepts.
Treaty:
- Proportional = Quota Share, Surplus, Combined Quota-cum-Surplus
- Non-Proportional = Per Risk Excess of Loss, Working Excess of Loss, Catastrophe Excess of Loss, Aggregate Excess of Loss (Stop Loss)</Description>

    <Description>Reinsurance and retained limits apply per risk as opposed to per occurrence or in the aggregate.
Use of this method for placement of extremely large or complex risks has been given an impetus by:
- Insufficient proportional capacity in the international reinsurance market,
- Disparities between the original rate and the global rate expected by reinsurers, and 
- The drive by insurers to optimize efficient deployment of capital by maximizing retention. 
Under this method, the loss potential of a single risk from any one loss into two layers above and below the Excess Point:
- Underlying Layer (Deductible or Loss Retention or Priority) - portion of each loss retained by the reassured on a first loss basis); and
- Limit of Indemnity - the excess over the Deductible borne by the Reinsurer up to a stipulated limit.
The subject matter insured is the Ultimate Net Loss, which is defined as meaning all sums actually paid by the Reinsured in respect of the loss including expenses of litigation and all other loss expenses but excluding office expenses and salaries of his employees. Salvages, third party recoveries and collections under prior proportional reinsurances shall first be deducted. 
The Risk Excess is distinct from Per Risk Excess of Loss and Working Excess of Loss, which are treaty methods employed for protection of all the individual risks comprised in a whole defined portfolio - rather than a specified individual risk. 
The trigger for attachment of Reinsurer’s liability under a Risk Excess is each loss. It is accordingly necessary to define this term because an accumulation of otherwise separate but arguably simultaneous losses can be caused by a single event (such as a riot or a natural calamity) affecting one and the same risk. Whereas a loss occurrence is defined in both temporal and spatial terms under the Hours Clause, all that is required under a Risk Excess is a temporal definition as the area covered is the specific location of the risk. 
If the Risk Excess method is used to handle a risk which itself is originally insured on First Loss basis for a fraction of the theoretical Value at Risk, the Indemnity may be so pegged that, when added to the Deductible, the resulting total is equivalent to the First Loss Limit of Liability relating to the facultative portion - regardless of the Value at Risk. However, if the risk is insured for the full Value at Risk (Total Sum Insured) but is underwritten on PML basis, it must be remembered that the insurer is nevertheless liable up to the full TSI - plus costs such as survey and adjustment charges, legal fees etc. Therefore, where there is a possibility of PML error, the Indemnity is stretched further - often up to the full TSI - by purchasing a relatively cheap sleep easy top layer.</Description>

    <Description>This method was originally developed to meet the requirements of direct insureds for the protection of industrial risks where, instead of maintaining large self-insured deductibles for each and every claim, the insured would bear on his own account the aggregate during the year of all low intensity / high frequency claims below a defined level in return for a discount in premium. This concept is sometimes used in facultative reinsurance to arrest attrition losses that are costly to handle for both cedent and reinsurer.</Description>

    <Description>Catastrophe treaty reinsurance protects the ceding insurer against a loss or losses in excess of a specified retention, from an accumulation of losses caused by a single catastrophic event or a series of events. A catastrophic event may be a sudden, violent, physical event that causes widespread and severe property damage, such as a hurricane. When a catastrophic event occurs, multiple policies are usually implicated, and catastrophe reinsurance protects these multiple losses.
Example: Company A writes 100 automobile policies in 2004 with exposure totaling $100,000. Company A enters into a Catastrophe Treaty Reinsurance agreement with Company B by which Company B agrees to assume all losses above $50,000 in the event of a catastrophic event.
A hurricane causes 25 cars to be totally demolished, resulting in a loss of $75,000. Company B is liable for $25,000.
On that same day, 10 other cars get into random accidents resulting in a loss of $10,000. Company B is not liable for the $10,000 under the Catastrophe Treaty because those ten cars were not damaged by the catastrophic event.</Description>

    <Description>The Coded XOL is a compromise between the Risk Excess (facultative method) and the Per Risk XOL Treaty (treaty method). Whilst cover is automatic for each and every risk within a defined portfolio, each risk has to be rated separately and declared under a periodical bordereau prepared by the Reassured on the basis of a premium formula agreed in advance with the Reinsurer. The difference between this arrangement and the Line Slip is that the estimated annual excess of loss premium is computed at inception and a deposit lodged with the Reinsurer, usually subject to a minimum premium on year-end adjustment.
Coded excess is considered more accurate in measuring exposure than averaging methods.</Description>

    <Description>Excess of Loss Treaty.
Excess of loss reinsurance is a method whereby an insurer pays the amount of each claim for each risk up to a limit determined in advance and the reinsurer pays the amount of the claim above that limit up to a specific sum. For example, assume that an insurer issues automobile liability policies of $150,000 on any one risk and retains the first $50,000 of any risk. The insurer purchases excess loss reinsurance for $100,000 in excess of $50,000 on any one risk. The insurer pays the first $50,000 of all losses, and the reinsurer pays any excess amount up to a maximum of $100,000.

Low or working layer excess of loss reinsurance: Reinsurance that absorbs the losses immediately above the reinsured's retention layer. A low layer excess of loss reinsurer will pay up to a certain monetary amount at which point a higher layer reinsurer or the ceding company will be liable for additional losses.  Also known as working layer reinsurance.</Description>

    <Description>The Interlocking Clause defines a provision in a reinsurance agreement designed to allocate loss from a single occurrence between two or more reinsurance agreements.  The provision is intended to be used when the company purchases its excess of loss reinsurance on an "underwriting year" or "risks attaching" basis.  The provision allows the reinsured to prorate its retention between two or more reinsurance agreement periods, i.e., when one loss affects policies assigned to different reinsurance periods, so that the company will have one retention and one recovery for the loss involving the two reinsurance periods.

This clause in a reinsurance treaty is designed to mesh and apportion loss from a single occurrence between two or more reinsurance contracts. The exact opposite is the event approach, designed to cause all loss from one occurrence to have one deemed date of loss, regardless of the number of dates of loss or reinsurance contracts involved.

Under an excess of loss cover on Issued and Renewed (Risks Attaching) basis, the Reassured would be exposed to two loss retentions (deductibles) if the same loss occurrence were to involve policies issued in two different underwriting years. The Interlocking Clause provides for pro rata distribution of the Ultimate Net Loss over the two years in such cases and apportionment of the limits based on such distribution:
Excess of Loss Limits 500,000 XS 100,000 each and every loss occurrence
Loss from the ground up 300,000 from the same event (involving 2 underwriting years)
Year Gross Loss Normal Cover Subject to Interlocking Clause

      <Description>Also known as Contingent commission.
This is an amount which the reinsurer agrees to pay to the reassured (usually under a proportional treaty and very rarely under a non-proportional treaty) as an incentive by way of profit participation. The results are arrived at after deduction from earned premium of losses incurred, ceding commission, taxes &amp; charges (but not brokerage) and an allowance for the reinsurer's management expenses (the M/E factor). Losses, if any, are carried forward to the computation of profit for a specified count of subsequent years or until extinction. A separate statement has to be prepared for each reinsurer because, apart from differences in ceding commission and rate of profit commission (as, for example, in the case of the Lead Reinsurer or a reciprocal reinsurer), only those losses may be carried forward which relate to the participation of a particular reinsurer in previous years. A new reinsurer cannot claim credit for losses carried forward relating to the outgoing reinsurer whom he has replaced. The commission may be a fixed percentage of the profit or calculated on a sliding scale. It is important for the cedent to render a profit commission statement within a reasonable time after rendering of accounts for the final quarter, even if the result is a loss because otherwise accounts would be incomplete and the loss to be carried forward will not be recorded. This also facilitates maintenance of cumulative treaty statistics over a period of years. Reinsurers would prefer allowing a generous profit commission to a higher basic commission. The rate is influenced by various factors - such as: - whether the treaty is well-established and has a clear pattern of past profitability or is unbalanced, with the dangerous potential that profits earned over several good years may be wiped out by a huge loss in a single year, - whether there is a substantial exposure to catastrophic losses (riots, elemental perils), thus requiring the reinsurer to incur additional costs on excess of loss protection for his share, - whether the treaty is placed on reciprocal basis or is placed as a bouquet supported by a book of more profitable business and - whether the basic commission itself incorporates a profit incentive (as discussed earlier). Where various treaties are placed together on 'bouquet' basis, profit commission is usually calculated on the combined results of the bouquet. Likewise, where a treaty is comprised of more than one section (Quota Share / Surplus, Domestic / Foreign risks, different sub-classes such as under General Accident). Calculation of profits under a bouquet becomes a bit of a problem if it contains long tail business such as Marine Cargo, CAR/EAR or liability. There is a theory which holds that no profit commission should be allowed under a quota share treaty as the results and interests of both parties under such a treaty are already the same (i.e. they share in both good and bad business) and there is no need for a further monetary inducement to the cedent for better management of the portfolio. The position under a surplus treaty is different as the cedent is in a position to influence the fortunes of the surpluses ceded without participating in the results. Profit commission is not usually allowed under automatic facultative and facultative obligatory treaties, where results tend to fluctuate widely and there is a potential for periodical heavy deficits. The objective in fixing the rate of profit commission would be to ensure that, combined with the basic commission; it does not eat up an unreasonable portion of the profit. The reinsurer should be allowed to retain an adequate margin in return for the risk he has run and in order that he is enabled to set aside reserves to finance the deficit in bad years. In order to achieve some flexibility on this front, it is common practice to have sliding scale or stepped up scales based on the profit ratio. While the ratio of profit for purposes of the formula is based on earned premium, the rate profit commission payable is applied to written premium.</Description>

      <Description>The commission paid by the reinsurer to the ceding company (primary insurer) on reinsurance agreements as compensation to place the business with the reinsurer and to cover the ceding company's acquisition expenses.

Also called Ceding commission or Exchange commission. The pricing mechanism (expressed as a percentage of premium ceded) under a proportional reinsurance contract, whereby the ceding company recoups the reinsurer's pro rata share of its original costs from the reinsurer (and, in addition, sometimes claims a margin for good will or presumptive profit). The cedent's original costs are comprised of acquisition costs (direct commission, brokerage) and management expenses (on risk inspection, issue of policies, underwriting, accounting, claims processing etc.) Commission is payable only under proportional reinsurance - whether facultative or treaty. The reason is that, under the proportional method, the reinsurer shares premiums with the cedent in direct proportion to his share of the sum insured and must likewise share the costs. Under the excess of loss method, there is no such sharing and the premium charged to the reassured is a net price related to the quantum of protection. If commission is only meant to recover actual original costs, it can be calculated easily. However, in practice, it is a pricing mechanism whereby the cedent tries to earn the highest possible reward for producing, controlling and managing a book of business which is then given in a packaged form to the reinsurer. The rate of commission therefore includes a premium for quality based on the merits and performance of the portfolio ceded. Commission terms vary, depending on basis of cession (OGR or ONR) In fixing the margin over and above original costs, the factors taken into account are the balance of the treaty, the track record of the treaty and future loss potential, extent of anti-selection against the reinsurer, types of risks and perils ceded, market norms for each class / treaty type, type of treaty, , whether treaty is traded reciprocally, cash flow potential, special relationship if any with the reinsurer, cost of administration of the treaty and, finally, the law of supply and demand. There are three types of commission: - Fixed Commission - Fixed plus Additional Commission linked to Loss Ratio - Sliding Scale Commission.</Description>

    <Description>Quota Share Treaty.
Quota share reinsurance is an automatic reinsurance that requires the insurer to transfer, and the reinsurer to accept, a given percentage of every risk within a defined category of business written by the insurer. For example, in the case of a 20% quota share, the insurer transfers 20% of its liability and premiums on every risk to the reinsurer, who must pay 20% of any loss sustained, whether total or partial. The percentage is constant throughout and applies to premiums and losses alike.</Description>

    <Description>Stop loss reinsurance protects a cedent against an aggregate amount of claims over a period, in excess of a specified percentage of the earned premium income. Stop loss reinsurance does not cover individual claims. The reinsurer's liability is limited to a stipulated percentage of the loss and/or a maximum currency amount. The stop loss method protects the cedent against the possibility that the aggregate value of an accumulation of small losses will exceed a specified percentage of earned premium income of a particular class. Stop loss reinsurance is the exact opposite of the quota share reinsurance and surplus reinsurance, and differs considerably from other forms of excess of loss reinsurance.

For example, a reinsurer can provide a cedent with 50% of the amount by which aggregate incurred losses of the cedent in any year exceed 70% of the cedent's earned premium income during that year.</Description>

    <Description>Surplus Share Treaty is a Proportional treaty.
Surplus reinsurance is an automatic reinsurance that requires an insurer to transfer (cede) and the reinsurer to accept the part of every risk that exceeds the insurer's predetermined retention limit. The reinsurer shares in premiums and losses in the same proportion as it shares in the total policy limits of the risk. The surplus method permits the insurer to keep for its own account small policies, and to transfer the amount of risk on large policies above its retention limit. For example, assume an insurer issues a policy for $20,000. The insurer keeps $5000 (¼) and transfers the remaining $15,000 (¼) to its reinsurer. This is called a three line surplus because the amount transferred equals three times the retained line of the insurer. The insurer keeps ¼ and transfers ¾ of the premium to the reinsurer. In the event of total loss, the settlements between the insurer and the reinsurer would be effected on the identical ¼-¾ basis. The same principal applies if there is a partial loss, in that the reinsurer must reimburse the insurer in the same proportion as the reinsurance premium received.</Description>

    <Description>An assessed likelihood or probability of a party taking a particular course of action. Such a score is typically derived from a mathematical model of consumer behavior and is used to support Customer Relationship Management processes.

 The following are typical types of propensity scores:

An Acquisition score indicates the probability of purchasing a particular product or group of products. 

A Cross-sell score indicates the probability of purchasing products not currently held with a particular provider, for example buying home contents insurance from an insurance company with which term life insurance is already held. 

An Up-sell score indicates the probability of upgrading a currently held product, for example, increasing the sum assured (face amount) under a life policy. 

A Retention score indicates the probability of a customer terminating their relationship with the modeled organization in whole or in part, for example surrendering an endowment policy. 
 
e.g: The propensity of Jane Browning to purchase a retirement annuity. 
 
e.g: The propensity of new home-buyers to purchase mortgage term life insurance.</Description>

    <Description>A claim coverage corresponds to a coverage involved in a claim as well as the assessment of coverage and the status of the claim coverage.

e.g. When a claim occurs, the general sequence involves:
(1) associating the claim to the related agreement/insurance policy
(2) determining whether the agreement includes coverage that corresponds to the damage
(3) determining whether the damage is covered by the applicable coverage in a manner that will result in benefits being paid by the insurer (e.g.the damage may be covered, but falls below the applicable deductible amount)
(4) managing the applicable coverage as a "claim coverage" to which amounts can be managed involving limits and/or deductibles, as well as amounts paid or reserved and to which a status may be applied.</Description>

    <Description>This concept define coordinates associated to a site (geographical situation).

It can be used to localize an object, a claim zone, etc.

A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that enables every location on Earth to be specified in three coordinates, using mainly a spherical coordinate system.

The Earth is not a sphere, but an irregular shape approximating an ellipsoid; the challenge is to define a coordinate system that can accurately state each topographical point as an unambiguous tuple of numbers. [1]

Attributes in this concept may need to be added for things like geodetic systems.

      <Description>Latitude is the angle from a point on the Earth's surface to the equatorial plane, measured from the center of the sphere. Lines joining points of the same latitude are called parallels, which trace concentric circles on the surface of the Earth, parallel to the equator. The north pole is 90° N; the south pole is 90° S. The 0° parallel of latitude is designated the equator, the fundamental plane of all geographic coordinate systems. The equator divides the globe into Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

    <AttributeProperty isSynthetic='true' name='localNumber' originalName='localNumber' assignable='true' index='0'>
      <Description>The local number (or subscriber number) must always be dialed in its entirety. The first few digits in the local number typically indicate smaller geographical areas or individual telephone exchanges. In mobile networks they may indicate a network provider in case the area code does not. Callers from a number with a given area/country code usually do not need to (but optionally may) include the particular area/country code in the number dialed, which enables shorter "dial strings" to be used. Devices that dial phone numbers automatically can include the full number with area and access codes, since there is no additional annoyance related to dialing extra digits.

Telex messages are routed by addressing them to a telex address, e.g., "14910 ERIC S", where 14910 is the subscriber number, ERIC is an abbreviation for the subscriber's name (in this case Telefonaktiebolaget L.M. Ericsson in Sweden) and S is the country code. Solutions also exist for the automatic routing of messages to different telex terminals within a subscriber organization, by using different terminal identities, e.g., "+T148".

    <AttributeProperty isSynthetic='true' name='trunkPrefix' originalName='trunkPrefix' assignable='true' index='0'>
      <Description>A trunk prefix is the number to be dialed in a domestic telephone call, preceding any necessary area codes and subscriber numbers. When the number is called from overseas, the trunk prefix is omitted by the caller. In most countries, such as Australia, Germany and the United Kingdom, the trunk prefix is 0. In the North American Numbering Plan it is 1.

For example, assume a call is to be made to someone in the Australian state of Queensland.  A caller from outside Australia would dial the international access number (international call prefix) of the originating country (00 for many countries, 011 from NANP areas), then dial the country code (in this case 61), omit the trunk prefix, then dial the area code (7), and then the local number: 00 61 7 3333 3333.

Calling interstate (e.g. from Western Australia), a caller would not dial an international access number or country code, but dial the trunk prefix then the area code, followed by the telephone number: 0 7 3333 3333

      <Description>A major advantage of telex is that the receipt of the message by the recipient could be confirmed with a high degree of certainty by the "answerback". At the beginning of the message, the sender would transmit a WRU (Who aRe yoU) code, and the recipient machine would automatically initiate a response which was usually encoded in a rotating drum with pegs, much like a music box. The position of the pegs sent an unambiguous identifying code to the sender, so the sender could verify connection to the correct recipient. The WRU code would also be sent at the end of the message, so a correct response would confirm that the connection had remained unbroken during the message transmission. This gave telex a major advantage over less verifiable forms of communications such as telephone and fax.

    <Description>The document drawn up by an insurer or broker setting out brief details of a proposed reinsurance to be purchased from a reinsurer and indicating the main terms and conditions. 

Unless specifically agreed, once an agreement is finalized in treaty reinsurance, the slip has to be replaced with a contract (Treaty or Facultative) which expands the wording in order to give it a more legal form and to incorporate implied provisions that were not specifically included in the slip for the sake of brevity. 

The agreement (policy) is deemed to be bound as soon as the reinsurer signs the slip submitted by the broker, hence great care has to be taken to incorporate all material clauses, conditions, warranties and exclusions in the slip. 

Very often slips serve as standalone 'slip policies' which are not required to be replaced by comprehensive contract documents as the implications of abbreviations and brief clause titles are understood universally. In the event of any inadvertent deviation, the intentions indicated in the slip shall take precedence. Where the deviation is the result of subsequent mutual agreement, it is necessary to bind the same through a proper addendum.</Description>

  <EntityType isSynthetic='true' name='org.acord.aim.Finance.FinancialProvisionSubtypes.CedingCommission' originalName='CedingCommission' superclassName='org.acord.aim.Finance.FinancialProvisionSubtypes.Commission' isAbstract='false'>
    <Description>The commission paid by the reinsurer to the ceding company (primary insurer) on reinsurance agreements as compensation to place the business with the reinsurer and to cover the ceding company's acquisition expenses.
Also called Exchange commission, or simply Reinsurance commission - the pricing mechanism (expressed as a percentage of premium ceded) under a proportional reinsurance contract, whereby the ceding company recoups the reinsurer's pro rata share of its original costs from the reinsurer (and, in addition, sometimes claims a margin for good will or presumptive profit). The cedent's original costs are comprised of acquisition costs (direct commission, brokerage) and management expenses (on risk inspection, issue of policies, underwriting, accounting, claims processing etc.) 
Commission is payable only under proportional reinsurance - whether facultative or treaty. The reason is that, under the proportional method, the reinsurer shares premiums with the cedent in direct proportion to his share of the sum insured and must likewise share the costs. Under the excess of loss method, there is no such sharing and the premium charged to the reassured is a net price related to the quantum of protection. If commission is only meant to recover actual original costs, it can be calculated easily. However, in practice, it is a pricing mechanism whereby the cedent tries to earn the highest possible reward for producing, controlling and managing a book of business which is then given in a packaged form to the reinsurer. The rate of commission therefore includes a premium for quality based on the merits and performance of the portfolio ceded. 
Commission terms vary, depending on basis of cession (OGR or ONR) In fixing the margin over and above original costs, the factors taken into account are the balance of the treaty, the track record of the treaty and future loss potential, extent of anti-selection against the reinsurer, types of risks and perils ceded, market norms for each class / treaty type, type of treaty, , whether treaty is traded reciprocally, cash flow potential, special relationship if any with the reinsurer, cost of administration of the treaty and, finally, the law of supply and demand.
There are three types of commission 
-  Fixed Commission
-  Fixed plus Additional Commission linked to Loss Ratio 
-  Sliding Scale Commission.</Description>

    <Description>Also known as Contingent commission - an amount which the reinsurer agrees to pay to the reassured (usually under a proportional treaty and very rarely under a non-proportional treaty) as an incentive by way of profit participation. The results are arrived at after deduction from earned premium of losses incurred, ceding commission, taxes &amp; charges (but not brokerage) and an allowance for the reinsurer's management expenses (the M/E factor). Losses, if any, are carried forward to the computation of profit for a specified number of subsequent years or until extinction. A separate statement has to be prepared for each reinsurer because, apart from differences in ceding commission and rate of profit commission (as, for example, in the case of the Lead Reinsurer or a reciprocal reinsurer), only those losses may be carried forward which relate to the participation of a particular reinsurer in previous years. A new reinsurer cannot claim credit for losses carried forward relating to the outgoing reinsurer whom he has replaced. The commission may be a fixed percentage of the profit or calculated on a sliding scale. It is important for the cedent to render a profit commission statement within a reasonable time after rendering of accounts for the final quarter, even if the result is a loss because otherwise accounts would be incomplete and the loss to be carried forward will not be recorded. This also facilitates maintenance of cumulative treaty statistics over a period of years. Reinsurers would prefer allowing a generous profit commission to a higher basic commission. The rate is influenced by various factors - such as 
- whether the treaty is well-established and has a clear pattern of past profitability or is unbalanced, with the dangerous potential that profits earned over several good years may be wiped out by a huge loss in a single year, 
- whether there is a substantial exposure to catastrophic losses (riots, elemental perils), thus requiring the reinsurer to incur additional costs on excess of loss protection for his share, 
- whether the treaty is placed on reciprocal basis or is placed as a bouquet supported by a book of more profitable business and 
- whether the basic commission itself incorporates a profit incentive (as discussed earlier).
Where a number of treaties are placed together on 'bouquet' basis, profit commission is usually calculated on the combined results of the bouquet. Likewise, where a treaty is comprised of more than one section (Quota Share / Surplus, Domestic / Foreign risks, different sub-classes such as under General Accident). Calculation of profits under a bouquet becomes a bit of a problem if it contains long tail business such as Marine Cargo, CAR/EAR or liability. There is a theory which holds that no profit commission should be allowed under a quota share treaty as the results and interests of both parties under such a treaty are already the same (i.e. they share in both good and bad business) and there is no need for a further monetary inducement to the cedent for better management of the portfolio. The position under a surplus treaty is different as the cedent is in a position to influence the fortunes of the surpluses ceded without participating in the results. Profit commission is not usually allowed under automatic facultative and facultative obligatory treaties, where results tend to fluctuate widely and there is a potential for periodical heavy deficits. The objective in fixing the rate of profit commission would be to ensure that, combined with the basic commission; it does not eat up an unreasonable portion of the profit. The reinsurer should be allowed to retain an adequate margin in return for the risk he has run and in order that he is enabled to set aside reserves to finance the deficit in bad years. In order to achieve some flexibility on this front, it is common practice to have sliding scale or stepped up scales based on the profit ratio. While the ratio of profit for purposes of the formula is based on earned premium, the rate profit commission payable is applied to written premium.

Profit commission under terminated treaties: Special provision is made for calculation of profit following the termination of a treaty in order to deal with items relating to future liabilities. So long as a treaty is in force, any release or strain resulting from the under-estimation or over-estimation of loss reserves creates no problem. However, where a treaty is terminated, the cedent would take the precaution of delaying the profit commission statement for the final year until all outstanding liabilities are extinguished.</Description>

    <Description>This concept is a generalizing concept providing further details about a person or an organization.
Some details regarding a party are not likely to be necessary to perform basic processes about parties. As such, they have been separated from basic party information and identified as details.
Examples are financial results of a company, family details...
Thus, a list of party details are linked to a party, being an organization or a party: asking for a detailed view of a party is tantamount to asking for this list.
Elements of this list are typed as:
- person specific details: birth and marriage details...
- organization specific details: financial results for instance
- fiscal residence
- tax file
- and membership (see Membership)

      <Description>An associate degree is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by community colleges, junior colleges, technical colleges, and bachelor's degree-granting colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study usually lasting two years. In the United States, and to some extent in Western Canada, an associate degree is equivalent to the first two years of a four-year college or university degree. It is the lowest in the hierarchy of post-secondary academic degrees offered in these countries. Although an associate degree is not usually as lucrative as a bachelor's degree, the resulting careers can still afford a respectable income with greater job security and much less student debt.

      <Description>A master's degree is an academic degree granted to individuals who have undergone study demonstrating a mastery or high-order overview of a specific field of study or area of professional practice.[1] Within the area studied, graduates are posited to possess advanced knowledge of a specialized body of theoretical and applied topics; high order skills in analysis, critical evaluation or professional application; and the ability to solve complex problems and think rigorously and independently.

In some languages, a master's degree is called a magister, and magister or a cognate can also be used for a person who has the degree. There are various degrees of the same level, such as engineer's degrees, which have different names for historical reasons.

    <Description>This concept gives particular features of a vehicle. This is the generalization of all types of vehicles.

The "motor vehicle" term is commonly used in vehicle registration and financial responsibility statutes. It is generally defined to mean a device capable of transporting people or property which is self-propelled by mechanical or electrical power. However, state "motor vehicle" definitions usually contain a list of exceptions of the kinds of vehicles that do not qualify, e.g., vehicles that are not designed for use on public roads, vehicles propelled solely by human power, bicycles, motorized wheelchairs or other electric personal assisting mobility devices, farm tractors, implements of husbandry, motorized bicycles, mopeds, snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, motor scooters, and vehicles running only upon rails or tracks. Each state's "motor vehicle" definition must be examined closely to see what types of vehicles qualify and what types do not. Any non-exempt vehicle that qualifies under a state statutory definition of a "motor vehicle" may be subject to that state’s licensing, registration and/or financial responsibility laws.</Description>

e.g: Commission calculations can be of different kinds: initial commissions are calculated at the creation of the agreement, while renewal commissions are calculated at every policy anniversary. You will also have different calculations for charges taken from the policy and commission expenses paid to the intermediaries. 

e.g: Initialization calculations are general calculations executed at the creation of the agreement. An example would be to calculate the value of deductible properties. 

e.g: Premium calculations are executed when the agreements are created. They can also be executed later on, for example at every renewal or when special events occur that have an impact on the agreements.

e.g: Profit share calculations are usually executed at policy anniversary dates to determine how much of the company's profit the policyholder is entitled to. 

e.g: Reserve calculations are usually calculated on the anniversary dates of a life insurance policy. They can also be calculated on demand, for example when a customer wants to surrender a life insurance policy, or to stop paying the premium so that the policy becomes paid-up. 

e.g: Surrender value calculations are executed in order to determine how much the policy is worth when a customer wants to surrender a life-insurance policy. 

e.g: Tax calculations are executed every time tax needs to be paid, which depending on the country can occur at the creation of the agreement, on each premium payment, on each benefit payment, or on special events that have an impact on the policy.</Description>

    <Description>This concept defines one deductible of a product coverage.

In an insurance policy, the deductible (North American term) or excess (UK term) is the portion of any claim that is not covered by the insurance provider. It is the amount of expenses that must be paid out of pocket before an insurer will cover any expenses. It is normally quoted as a fixed quantity and is a part of most policies covering losses to the policy holder. The deductible must be paid by the insured, before the benefits of the policy can apply. Typically, a general rule is: the higher the deductible, the lower the premium, and vice versa.

In a typical automobile insurance policy, a deductible will apply to claims arising from damage to or loss of the policy holder's own vehicle, whether this damage/loss is caused by accidents for which the holder is responsible, or vandalism and theft. Third-party liability coverage generally has no deductible, since the third party will likely attempt to recover any loss, however small, for which the policy holder is liable.

Most health insurance policies and some travel insurance policies have deductibles as well. The type of health insurance deductibles can also vary, as individual amounts and family amounts. Major medical insurance policies are known for often having a deductible which does not cover the cost of routine visits (e.g., to a doctor's office).

For example, a person might have an auto insurance policy with a $500 deductible on collision coverage. If this person were in an accident that did $800 worth of damage to the car, then the insurance company would pay him or her $300. The insured is responsible for the first $500 of damage (the deductible), and the insurance company pays the balance. In industrial risks it is also common for the deductible to be expressed as a percentage of the loss, often though not always, with a minimum and maximum amount, for example 10% of loss minimum 1,500USD max 5,000USD. Therefore in the event of a claim totaling 25,000USD the applicable deductible is 2,500 (i.e. 10% of the loss), meaning that the assured would receive an indemnity payment from the insurer of 22,500USD. If the claim only amounts to 7,500USD then the applicable deductible is 1,500USD and not 10% of the loss, since 10% is below the minimum deductible level. Similarly, in this instance, for losses above 50,000USD the deductible will never be more than 5,000USD. Deductibles can also differ depending on the cause of the claim: the same policy can contain varying deductibles which are applied to loss or damage arising from theft, fire, natural perils, etc.

For example a plastics factory may have a deductible of 10,000 for theft, 50,000 for natural perils and 100,000 for fire.

There are two types of deductibles:
- Straight deductible: A straight deductible is a deductible that applies to each separate loss, and is the type of deductible in most personal lines of insurance. For instance, if, during the course of a year, you are involved in 2 separate auto accidents, then the deductible will be subtracted for each accident.
- Aggregate deductible:
Commercial insurance often has an aggregate deductible, which is the total deductible for a given policy period. For instance, if a business has property insurance with an aggregate deductible of $10,000, then the business will have to cover the 1st $10,000 worth of losses for each policy period - usually a year. So if, during the course of a year, a business has 3 separate losses of $2,000, then $6,000, then $4,000, the business will be have to cover $10,000 of its losses, but will receive $2,000 from its insurance company for the last loss. Any more losses that occur within the same policy period will be fully covered. So if the business has another loss of $3,000, it will receive the full amount from its insurer.
An aggregate deductible makes more sense in commercial insurance, since businesses can have many separate losses during the course of a year, but would be unusual for an individual to experience multiple losses within a year.


A deductible should never be confused with a franchise, the latter representing a threshold which needs to be exceeded in order for the insurer to be liable for the entirety of the claim. In other words, with a franchise of 20,000 USD a claim of 19,900 USD is borne entirely by the assured whereas in the event of a claim totaling 20,500 USD the insurer would be liable for the whole amount.</Description>

    <Description>This concept defines one franchise of a product coverage.

A franchise is similar to a deductible in that the insurer makes no settlement if the total claim is below the franchise figure. However, if the claim is above the franchise figure, the claim is paid in full. Franchises are very unusual in modern insurance practice though machinery breakdown covers sometimes use time franchises.
It can be interpreted in amount, percentage, time unit.

Franchise clause: Clause found in a marine insurance policy that states that the policy will not pay any claims less than a given amount but will pay claims in excess of that amount. The purpose of this clause is to eliminate the costs associated with processing small claims because their costs could easily exceed the actual amount of the claim. This is a form of deductible insurance.</Description>

Waiting period deductible: 
(1) A deductible provision sometimes used in business interruption and other time element policies, in lieu of a currency amount deductible, that establishes that the insurer is not responsible for loss suffered during a specified period of time (such as 72 hours) immediately following a direct damage loss. 
(2) A deductible mechanism in disability income policies and under workers compensation statutes that establishes a period of time which must pass following an accident or illness causing disability before salary continuation benefits are payable.
Synonym: Elimination period.

2. An American tax filing status, the definition of which is:

Generally, to qualify for head of household status you must be unmarried, not entitled to file as a qualifying widow or widower, and have a dependent child. You must also have provided more than half the cost of maintaining, as your home, a household that was the main home for a qualifying dependent. You may also qualify for head of household status if you, though married, file a separate return and your spouse was not a member of your household during the last six months of the tax year and you provided more than half of the cost of maintaining, as your home, a household that was the main home, for more than one half of your tax year, of a child who is a qualifying dependent.

    <Description>In the United Kingdom, insurers enter into agreements with coverholders. These brokers act as agents for insurers, writing insurance contracts on their behalf and serving as their local representatives. Coverholders enable insurers to extend their geographic reach by benefiting from local knowledge of risks and market conditions in other parts of the UK or the world.

A "Coverholder"  means a company or partnership authorised by a managing agent to enter into a contract or contracts of insurance to be underwritten by the members of a syndicate managed by it in accordance with the terms of a binding authority.
SOURCE:
http://www.lloyds.com/The-Market/I-am-a/Coverholder/Information-for-Brokers-and-Agents/What-is-a-coverholder

There are two types of coverholder at Lloyd’s namely "Approved Coverholders" and "Restricted Coverholders".  In addition, some Approved Coverholders may also be classified as "Service Company Coverholders". Lloyd’s rules provide for the type of binding authority that each of these types of coverholder may be granted.
SOURCE:
http://www.lloyds.com/The-Market/I-am-a/Coverholder/Information-for-Brokers-and-Agents/What-is-a-coverholder

A coverholder is party role with authority to bind risks to an original Master Cover contract or Binding Authority. The role is one where, on behalf on an insurance company, the party assumes responsibilities including and not limited to: underwriting risks, administering policies, collecting premiums, servicing and paying claims.  The coverholder and the insurance company typically have a separate contractual relationship that outlines details of the types of risks etc. the coverholder can underwrite and administer on the insurance company’s behalf, and also the extent of the administration activity they undertake.

One example of a coverholder is an MGA (managing general agent) in the USA, who has delegated authority to underwrite and administer surplus lines risks on behalf of insurers such as Lloyd’s syndicates and surplus lines insurers.  In this example the original producer is generally the insurance agent, who takes a risk to an MGA when they cannot get coverage in the particular State where the risk is located.  However, examples outside USA will often see the coverholder marketing directly to insured’s rather than relying on risks fed from normal agents.

Whether acting as an agent (producer) for an insurance company based on authorization granted by the insurance company, or acting as a producer on behalf of another producer, a coverholder is a producer.</Description>

    <Description>A financial adviser (UK spelling) or financial advisor (US spelling), more recently often referred to as a financial planner, is a professional who renders financial planning services to individuals, businesses and governments. This can involve investment advice, which may include pension  planning, and/or advice on Life insurance and other insurances such as income protection insurance, critical illness insurance etc, and/or advice on mortgages.

Ideally, the financial adviser helps the client maintain the desired balance of investment income, capital gains, and acceptable level of risk by using proper asset allocation. Financial advisers use stock, bonds, mutual funds, real estate investment trusts (REITs), options, futures, notes, and insurance products to meet the needs of their clients. Many financial advisers receive a commission payment for the various financial products that they broker, although "fee-based" planning is becoming increasingly popular in the financial services industry.

A further distinction should be made between "fee-based" and "fee-only" advisers. Fee-based advisers often charge asset based fees but may also collect commissions. Fee-only advisers do not collect commissions or referral fees paid by other product or service providers.

"Client-Centered" investment advisors only charge a fee based on the assets managed for the client. Typically they charge about 1.0 to 1.5% per year to make the investment decisions for the client. They do not collect commissions.</Description>

    <Description>This concept states an organization's role as a reinsurance brokerage.

Legislation in most countries requires authorization of direct producers (both agents and brokers) and regulation of their activities. No such restrictions have applied historically to reinsurance brokers for two reasons : 
a) Reinsurance broking is an activity which extends beyond national borders (often involving two countries, where co-broking is done with correspondent brokers) and, if it were to be regulated, it would be subject to numerous jurisdictions, and 
b) Regulatory legislation is prompted by concern for the security of retail insurance customers and the public in general. Reinsurance contracts do not involve this concern as they are agreements between two professionals with expert knowledge of the business transacted by them. This situation is however changing to some extent and regulations are being framed to cover: 
- minimum capital requirements, 
- minimum solvency margin, 
- proof of adequate professional indemnity insurance coverage (based on turnover, with a ceiling on maximum permitted self-insured deductible), 
- proof of professional insurance qualifications of the directors, 
- segregation of own funds from fiduciary funds, 
- submission of prescribed audited returns to the regulator, and access of regulatory authorities for inspection of records.

Historically, reinsurance brokers have played a significant role in the development of London as a global reinsurance center. The majority of London reinsurance brokers are subsidiaries of larger direct producer and risk management groups but operate quite independently, some being specialized in certain concepts of business. Owing to the international scope of their activities, many travel extensively and some even maintain a network of overseas offices in addition to regular dealing with correspondent brokers in other countries. The role and functions of the reinsurance broker cover a wide field: 
- Collection and dissemination of up-to-date market intelligence as also firsthand information on individual companies so as to enhance the marketing base of participating cedants and reinsurers, 
- Technical assistance to cedents (inspection and rating of peak or complicated risks, drawing up of policy wordings and clauses, survey and processing of claims, fixing of retentions and treaty limits, devising of cost-effective reinsurance programmes, screening of security of reinsurers and maintenance of an early warning system against potential defaults and bankruptcies),
- Negotiation of lead terms and quotes that are equitable and fair so as to ensure continuity and long term support from first concept security,
- Spreading the placement across a wide international spectrum with due regard to the special capabilities and expertise of various markets, 
- Conduct of renewal negotiations and reciprocal trading terms,
- Assistance in preparation and transmission of contract documents, accounts, reports and loss advices, 
- Assistance in settlement of bilateral accounts, currency management and investment of funds overseas, 
- Assistance in resolution of disputes, including the conduct of arbitration proceedings and court action - especially in case of existence of a language barrier or disputes between the countries of domicile of the parties to a dispute (the neutrality of the broker being an invaluable aid in avoiding otherwise delicate or embarrassing confrontations), 
- Technical aid in development of new or complex concepts of business, 
- Assistance in training of the staff of cedents, 
- Assistance in implementing latest available technology tools (including IT tools) for upgrading internal administrative and accounting procedures of the cedent and 
- Assistance in development of a mutually beneficial and satisfactory long term relationship between the cedent and his reinsurers.</Description>
